# PanLang

PanLang is a modern, Sanskrit-inspired programming language designed for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. The language is built for clarity, expressiveness, and power, supporting both traditional and cutting-edge workflows. Its architecture is modular, extensible, and optimized for high-performance and multilingual environments.

## Project Status

**This project is actively under development by Chinmay Duse(Psyphon1).**  
I am building PanLang as a next-generation language for AI/ML and scientific research.

## Features

- **Sanskrit-centric syntax** with English supplements for accessibility.
- **Full-stack language tools:** lexer, parser (Lark/Pest/ANTLR), AST, compiler, VM/interpreter, and CLI.
- **Rich standard library** for math, string, list, table, NLP, and AI/ML operations.
- **Integrated NLP and AI/ML modules** for modern research and production needs.
- **Extensive documentation** and error messages in both Sanskrit and English.
- **Designed for scientific, educational, and multilingual use.**
